    <p>&nbsp;<h3>Music Is Good For You 
	</h3>
	<p>&nbsp;<h3>----------------------------------

	<h3 class="pulse">Music Influences You Psychologically</h3>
	<p>Do you have a specific song you like to listen to when you’re doing certain things? Maybe it’s a hype song you listen to when you’re getting ready to give a presentation at work. Maybe you have your own personal jam that gets you motivated to practice, work out, or even stay focused on what you need to do. Or, maybe you have a specific song you listen to when you’re sad. Many people create specific playlists for different situations in life such as moving, long-distance traveling, or finals prep in college, because they know exactly which songs they need to get through those activities.

        It’s not just coincidence that we listen to certain types of music and even specific songs when we’re feeling a specific way. Music has a huge impact on how we feel and our behaviors. When you listen to happier, more upbeat music, you’re more likely to participate in positive behaviors. Upbeat music can make just about anything seem better. Music can also improve the behavior of children, helping them to become more social, empathetic, and sympathetic.
        
        What more, while just listening to music can have all these wonderful impacts, actually playing instruments can have a host of health and mood benefits as well. The act of playing an instrument can help a person reduce stress, manage anxiety levels, and boost creativity.
        
        So, why does music have such a big impact on the way you feel? Research has suggested that it’s all about dopamine. Certain types of music activate dopamine receptors in your brain, allowing the hormone to give you feelings of happiness and comfort. That’s why you feel good when you’re listening to your favorite dance track, and you feel better when you’re listening to a break-up song. It’s more than just an interesting finding, though. Because music has such a powerful impact on how we feel and mood regulation, it can be used for things like mental health treatments and therapies for some neurological disorders.
